COLABORATIVE AGENDA 3C PROJECT

----------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, my name is Francisco Fleury and I'm currently a highshcool student. As I am studying super hard for my tests, keeping up with homework schedule has been a nightmare. So me and my friends decide to develop a discord bot using discord.py to help people with a colaborative homework agenda. It worked well. However, a lot of my classmates either don't have discord or have little experience with it. Having said that, I decided to build a website easy to use, where everyone could add tasks and it's deadlines.
